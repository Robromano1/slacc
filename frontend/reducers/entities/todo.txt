sidebar channels and dms update when user is added in realtime w/o refresh

right now:
CHANNEL_CREATION:
createChannel - creates channel in database with name and ownerid
            - receive channel in channels slice of state
updateUserChannels - action, adds channel to user's channel_ids in users slice of state
                    - also adds user_id to channel's member_ids in channel reducer
addChannel - actually updates the channel in the database without having to call receiveChannel
redirect

DM_CREATION:
createDm - create dm in databse
updateUserDms - updates dm with member ids and users dm_ids
redirect

IDEAS:
in dm/channel, can broadcast any changes in database

REFACTORING
1) may have to refactor ajax calls, only make ajax call on initial load
remove from anywhere except component did mount

2) update users sidebar and participating channels once loaded with broadcasts

CHANNEL REFACTORING
new_channel_form.jsx
chat_channel.rb -backend
    add method add_members which takes in an array of member_ids
channel.jsx - frontend
    add_method in App.cable.subscriptions.subscriptions.create
    add_members which takes in an array of member_ids
    in received function, need to update the sidebar props -> action?
    may need to make the new channel form an overlay instead of explicitly a different url
channels_index.jsx gets subscribed channels and previewed channels in the users channel_ids
move addChannel logic into the received callback
or collapse addChannel/updateUserChannels into adding it to everyone
change line 52-55 in new_channel_form

in new_channel_form

in channel.jsx
    case 'addMembers':
        addChannel(JSON.parse)
        break;

DM REFACTORING
new_dm_form.jsx
dm_channel.rb - backend
    parallel add_members in dmchannel

EDITING/DELETING MESSAGES
add edit/delete message cases to dm_form, etc.

REFACTORING PATHS:
right now: ndf/bc/ncf in App.jsx
need to move to homepage.jsx => routes now include home
